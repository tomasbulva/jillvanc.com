                This is a personal project where I married two of my obsessions: gopros &amp; pictograms <br>
                Iâ€™ve shot and watched hours of breathtaking images shot on gopro cameras.<br>
                I wanted to create an animated story that shows how these cameras help us perceive and share the world in a new way. <br>
                I also love infographics and pictograms, the power of communicating an idea with a single image fascinates me so this became the look and feel for the video.
